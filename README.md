# Victory

## A Very Simple Run Tracker

Victory is an iOS app created to display implementations of several programming paradigms and technologies. It's also a handy little alternative to the popular run tracking apps which force users to log in with social accounts and/or share data with parties they may or may not know.

Victory tracks and displays a user's location, distance traveled, and run duration. This information is saved in a Realm database on the user's device.

Feel free to use the source code for projects of your own, or submit issues and pull requests to help me keep this project current and bugless.

#### Victory uses the following:

* App Coordinator pattern
* Protocol Oriented Programming
* Realm Mobile Database
* Cocoapods
* MapKit and CoreLocation
* AVFoundation

## To Do

There's a lot of room for improvement. You'll get a big thanks and much appreciation for any contributions you make! üòç

#### Some known issues and ideas:

* Add sort options for the run list.
* Improve UI of run details.
* Save and display thumbnails of the run maps on the run list.
* Allow users to select alternate units.
* Add language localization.
* **Bug**: Map doesn't load polyline until moved.
