# Victory

## A Very Simple Run Tracker

Victory is an iOS app created to display implementations of several programming paradigms and technologies. It's also a handy little alternative to the popular run tracking apps which force you to log in with social accounts and/or share data with parties you may or may not know.

Victory tracks and displays a your location, distance traveled, and run duration. This information is saved in a Realm database on the your device.

Feel free to use the source code for projects of your own, or submit issues and pull requests to help me keep this project current and bugless.

> **Note:** Victory is built in and designed for Swift 4 / Xcode 9 and later.

#### Victory uses the following:

* Coordinator Pattern
* Functional Design
* Dependency Injection
* Protocol Oriented Programming
* Realm Mobile Database
* Cocoapods
* MapKit and CoreLocation
* AVFoundation

#### Some known issues and ideas:

* Add sort options for the run list.
* Improve UI of run details.
* Save and display thumbnails of the run maps on the run list.
* Allow users to select alternate units.
* Add language localization.
* Allow database to save to iCloud.
* **Bug**: Polyline may not load until map is manually moved.
